# Supervised-classification
The main goal of this assignment is to understand how supervised classification techniques work.

Download the following datasets: circles0.3, moons1, spiral1, twogaussians33, twogaussians42, and halfkernel.

Run the following classifiers on all downloaded datasets:
a. LDA (linear discriminant analysis)
b. Quadratic (quadratic discriminant analysis)
c. Naïve Bayes: Choose a distribution and explain why you chose it.
d. SVM: Choose a kernel and explain why you chose it.

For each classifier, provide the following five performance measures: PPV, NPV, specificity, sensitivity and accuracy.

3. Plot the samples of the all datasets (in separate plots) as points in the 2D space, using a different color and point shape for each class.
4. Briefly discuss the performance (accuracy only) for each classifier and dataset individually: Why do you think it is good/poor?
5. For each classifier: which classifier is the best for that particular dataset, why?including mathematical formulas and/or arguments.
6. Mathematical sketch of proof of how Naïve Bayes that uses Gaussian distributions is a simplified form of the quadratic (optimal Bayesian) classifier.
